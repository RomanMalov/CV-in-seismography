# CV-in-seismography
This is my code for diploma work in usage of CV(specifically U-net architecture) in reverse problem of seismography.

I created synthetic 2d dataset of the top of Earth's crust and run simulations of explosions and recorded measurements from the surface. 

Then I trained U-net model on this dataset, and got decent results.
